# quant-gan-test
Numerical experiment of the distinguishability of financial data generated by the model in Wiese et al.'s Quant GAN [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06673).

Run 1on1comparison.py to train and test an LSTM model on the different datasets; generates summarizing plots in /img.
In particular the images in the article can be found in /img/100_epochs,_1x5.

generate_data.py generates the files real_data.npy, garch_data.npy, gbm_data.npy. The file gan_data.npy was generated in QuantGAN.ipynb, which I added for completeness, which is [this](https://github.com/KseniaKingsep/quantgan) implementation, with some modifications.
